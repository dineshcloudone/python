Python Modules :
o To know all python modules search for "python 3 module index" in google
o None is an object in python

Methods :
1. If you define a method inside class then self should be given as parameter in the method.
2. For static methods you don't need to give any first implicit parameter which is self

Functions :
1. By default functions return None object

Module : A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

Package : 
1. Python modules may contain several classes, functions, variables, etc. whereas Python packages contain several modules. In simpler terms, Package in Python is a folder that contains various modules as files.
2. python package will have __init__.py file to represent it is a package

Pypi(https://pypi.org): python package index, in this you can find thousands of packages 
openpyxl : package to use for excel

Method Overloading : Python doesn't support method overloading

pipfile and pipfile.lock : (youtube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74pSNpgHFGo)
link : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46330327/how-are-pipfile-and-pipfile-lock-used

 o pip install -r requirements.txt = traditional way of installing python packaged which is dependencies
 o pip freeze (to see the packages installed)
 o pip install pipenv
 o pipenv lock  (to lock the packages mentioned in Pipfile and create pipfile.lock)
 o pipenv install -d (to install dev packages)
 o pipenv --rm (to remove the environment already created by Pipfile)
 o pipenv install (it can be used with requriements.txt, it will create Pipfile and pipenv.lock)

Steps to generate pip lock file :
    Sure! Here's how you can generate a `Pipfile.lock` file that contains the specified packages and versions:

    1. First, make sure you have `pipenv` installed. If not, you can install it by running `pip install pipenv`.
    2. Next, navigate to your project directory and create a `Pipfile` by running `pipenv install`. This will create a virtual environment for your project and generate a `Pipfile`.
    3. Open the `Pipfile` in a text editor and add the following lines under the `[packages]` section:
    ```
    pytest = "==3.6"
    selenium = "==4.2"
    ```
    4. Save the `Pipfile` and run `pipenv lock` to generate the `Pipfile.lock` file.

    The `Pipfile.lock` file will now contain the specified packages and versions. You can use `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile` to install the packages specified in the `Pipfile.lock` file.

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
