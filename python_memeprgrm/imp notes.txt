Need to explore mutable and immutable in python : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutable-vs-immutable-objects-in-python/

type() : to know the type of variable
id() : to know the memory location of given variable

"_" (underscore) : to get the previous output

identifier : it can be a variable name, function name , class name

Python has several built-in data types and classes for representing different types of data. Here are some of the commonly used built-in data types and classes in Python:

    1. int: Represents integers (whole numbers).
    2. float: Represents floating-point numbers (real numbers with a decimal point).
    3. str: Represents strings (sequences of characters).
    4. list: Represents lists (ordered, mutable collections of items).
    5. tuple: Represents tuples (ordered, immutable collections of items).
    6. dict: Represents dictionaries (unordered, key-value pairs).
    7. set: Represents sets (unordered collections of unique items).
    8. bool: Represents Boolean values (True or False).
    9. NoneType: Represents the absence of a value (similar to null in other languages).
    10. complex: Represents complex numbers (numbers with a real and imaginary part).
    11. bytes: Represents immutable sequences of bytes.
    12. bytearray: Represents mutable sequences of bytes.
    13. list, tuple, dict, and set can contain elements of various data types, including other objects, and can be nested to create more complex data structures.
    14. There are also data types and classes provided by Python modules and libraries, such as datetime for handling date and time values, re for regular expressions, and many more.
    15. Additionally, you can create your own custom classes to represent specific data structures and objects tailored to your application's needs.

Built in core python regular use modules :
1. keyword module
2. string module
3. itertools module
4. collections 
5. random
6. date
7. time
8. math
9. array
10. statistics module
11. os module
12. re module
13. sys module
14. heapq module
15. operators module
16. functools
17. textwrap
18. venv
19. queue
20. enum
21. bisect
22. calendar
23. abc
24. Modules used on string data type : string,re,difflib,textwrap,unicodedata,stringgrep, readline, rlcompleter
25. number datatype : numbers,math,cmath, decimal, fractions,random, statistics
26. create different datatypes :
